Hey there 👋🏼 I'm Jae and I am glad to see you here. I am a graduate student pursuing phd in computer science.

Before I started my graduate studies at the Iowa State University, I have obtained my BS in computer science and minor in math from Drake University. 

> Academically I am currently interested in **model checking**, **theorem proving**, and **computer science education**. I was fortunate to meet many of academic mentors who helped me to shape my journey, and I hope to do the same in the future.

Outside of school, I enjoy lifting and training judo. 

**I am a**
1. Software Engineer
2. Jr. Researcher
3. Educator in making
